## About me

My name is Jun Noh, I am currently a student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo pursuing a BS in Statistics and hoping to graduate in 2025. Through this website, I aim to share my experiences, projects, and insights related to data science and statistics. I am particularly interested in the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with friends/family, and enjoying the outdoors in my free time.
